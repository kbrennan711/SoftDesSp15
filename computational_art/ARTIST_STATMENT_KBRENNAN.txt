Random functions used to create the artwork (red, green and blue channels):
x(a,b) = a
y(a,b) = b
sqr(a,b) = a^2
prod(a,b) = ab
avg(a,b) = 0.5*(a+b)
cos_pi(a) = cos(pi*a)
sin_pi(a) = sin(pi*a)
tan(a,b) = tan(a)

Title of Composition: Example1_Part2
Themes: The a random order of nested functions above generated this art peice using recursion. The picture is very colorful and abstract. The meaning of this work is still being explored. 

Major Influences as an artist: This peice is somewhat similar to Jaison Cianelli (http://www.abstractartistgallery.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/abstract-art-somebodys-smiling.jpg)

Title of Composition: Example2_LambdaFunction
Themes: Similar to Example1_Part2, this picture generated by evaluating a random order of nested functions, but this peice involved lambda functions. The symmetry and bright colors in this photo contributes to the attractiveness of the picture. 

Major Influences as an artist: This peice is models the work of Kelly Brower (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/01/15/01/0115018be1bb05a7a43e43d80e418435.jpg)
