Print those scores:
f_score = Score for each square: F = G + H; 
	value changes to determine final cost (function of g_score and h_score). In 		the example, Paul must move a minimum of 20 squares. The squares at the end 
	of his journey have a higher score because G + H at that location = 20. For 
	example, in the square right before the cake: G = 19 & H = 1, H + G = 20.
g_score = the cost it takes paul to get from his starting point to a given square. 		In the example, we see that paul must move at least 18 squares.
h_score = the number of squares between Paul and the cake at a given location
