Genotype Representation: Why is this implemented with a list of characters instead of a string?
The text formation is implemented with a list of characters instead of a string to append randomly choosen components of the string to form it and for the mutation function to use list processes to create the mutations.

Format of Statistics:
Population Size|Final Population Size|Average Fitness value (lower the better)|Standard Deviation|Fitness Minimum|Fitness Maximum|

Changing population size or number or generations to run in evolve_string:
With 500 Generations (initial) and population size at 300:
'SJKYNET IS NOWW ONLIN'
500	187   	2.18   	0.401165	2  	4  

With 700 generations and population size at 300:
'SKYNET IS NOWW ONLIN'
700	165   	2.24667	0.453676	2  	5  

With 300 generations and population size at 300:
'SKYNET IS NWW ONLIN'
300	175   	2.21667	0.42785 	2  	4  

With 500 generations and population size at 100:
'SKYNET ISPWXNOJW ONLINV'
500	60    	4.19 	0.392301	4  	5  

With 500 generations and population size at 500:
